# Phases

# Analysis
I run the analysis explaining my requirement in ultrathink. I use this at the end of my prompt

ultrathink and traverse and analyse the code to thorougly understand the context before preparing a detailed plan to implement the requirement

Before finalising the plan you can ask me any question to clarify the requirement

# openspec proposal

When the analysis is complete I just ask CC to create an openspec proposal with a simple

create an openspec proposal for this

# openspec validation

When the Openspec files are ready, I THOROUGHLY VALIDATE THEM. This means I read them, understand what CC understood and fix them for as long as it's needed until I am happy.

Lots of this is based on my own understanding of the platform I am working on. Skipping this validation part is like asking for troubles.

# beads creation

When the openspec is ready I use this command

Import the tasks from this OpenSpec change into Beads

This depends on the Specific commands in Claude.md and Agents.md

# beads execution

When everything else is ready I either run the beads one after the other, or I run a list of them in one go
